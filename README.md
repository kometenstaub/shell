# Shell scripts

This is a collection of shell scripts.

## update_plugin

This script is meant to facilitate updating plugins which are not in the Obsidian community plugins store. Either the developer doesn't want to submit the plugin or it is still in development before it is submitted.

I created the script to make being a plugin beta tester easier. Currently, I have only tested it with the plugin you can find under the sample URL.

See the comments for more details.

You may have to adjust the code slightly for the plugin you want to use it with.
